### 1. What is exception handling, and why is it important in Spring Boot applications?
Exception handling is the process of responding to runtime errors or unexpected events in a controlled manner. In programming, exceptions are disruptions that occur during the execution of a program, such as a division by zero, invalid input, or an unavailable resource.

In Java, exceptions are categorized into:

Checked Exceptions - Must be declared or handled explicitly (e.g., IOException).
Unchecked Exceptions - Do not need explicit handling (e.g., NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).
Errors - Serious problems that are typically beyond application control (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).
Why is Exception Handling Important in Spring Boot Applications?

In Spring Boot, proper exception handling is crucial for the following reasons:

Improved User Experience
Exception handling ensures that end-users receive meaningful and user-friendly error messages instead of system-generated stack traces. For instance, a custom error message like "Resource not found" is better than "java.lang.NullPointerException".

Consistency
It allows developers to define a uniform error response structure (e.g., HTTP status codes, error messages, timestamps) across the application, especially for REST APIs.

Maintainability
Centralized exception handling simplifies code maintenance by separating error-handling logic from business logic.

Debugging and Logging
Exception handlers can log details about errors, making it easier to debug and trace issues in production.

Resilience
Proper handling prevents the application from crashing due to unhandled exceptions, ensuring that the application can continue functioning or degrade gracefully.

Customization
Spring Boot provides mechanisms to create custom exceptions and responses, allowing developers to tailor error handling to specific application requirements.

Compliance and Security
Exception handling helps meet compliance requirements by masking sensitive information in error messages and preventing data leaks.
